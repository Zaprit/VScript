Vscript is a tool for making librarys and reuseable code for bash that i made for ease of use.
Bash can be a useful tool for scripting and I thought, hmm can i make this easier for myself, It turned out I could.

Grab the source code off the [Releases page](http://henry.vorax.org/git/PackageDevs/Vscript/releases) and run the installer script

## How to develop
inside the test folder you will find the test environment and that can be used
to create libs.
The vsbuild script can be used to compile your library for use with vscript, just edit the ID, NAME, and DESC in the vsbuild so that they match your project.
in the src folder you can make your 'classes' for example:
`foo(){
echo "bar"
}`
and so on.
