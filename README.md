# VScript -- A Bash Library Tool

## About
VScript is a group of tools that come together to form a coherent tool for building complex bash applications

## Download
Grab the latest SDK and vsruntime.base off the [Releases page](https://tyr123.ddns.net/henry/VScript/releases) and unzip it, or for the more adventurous you could grab the ADK and make your own vsruntime

## How to develop
There are two kits the sdk and the rdk the sdk is for most people who just want to code, the rdk is for people who want optimisation, customisation or anything inbetween it will allow you to make your own so that you can strip VScript down or add your own stuff in vsruntime.base 

if you want to develop using either you should stop by the wiki and see the tutorials
