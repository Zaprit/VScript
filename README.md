# VScript -- A Bash Library Tool

## About
VScript is a group of tools that come together to form a coherent tool for building complex bash applications

## Download
Grab the latest SDK and vsruntime.base off the [Releases page](https://tyr123.ddns.net/henry/VScript/releases) and unzip it and read its README.

## How to develop
There are two kits the sdk and the rdk the sdk is for most people who just want to code, the rdk is for people who want optimisation, customisation or anything inbetween it will allow you to make your own so that you can strip VScript down or add your own stuff in vsruntime.base

## Compiling your own runtime
If you wish to include your own libs in the vsruntime or wish to strip it down just download the source code from the releases page and run mkruntime... if you wish to remove libs then just remove them from the libs folder then just put your custom runtime in the include folder of your app
